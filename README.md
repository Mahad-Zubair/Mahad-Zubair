# Hi there! 👋 I'm Mahad Zubair

- 👀 I'm interested in exploring the endless possibilities of computer science and technology!
- 🌱 I'm currently diving deep into the realms of machine learning and web development.
- 💞️ I'm always on the lookout for exciting projects to collaborate on, so if you've got one, count me in!
- 📫 You can reach out to me via email at mahadzubair96@gmail.com or find me on [LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com/in/mahad-zubair-a07709223).

## About Me

I'm a passionate computer science student currently sailing through my 7th semester. With a blend of curiosity and caffeine, I'm always ready to tackle new challenges and learn something new. When I'm not coding, you can find me sipping on coffee, exploring the latest tech trends, or playing video games.

## Tech Stack

- Languages: Python, HTML, CSS, C++, SQL, Java
- Tools: Git, VS Code, Jupyter Notebook, Co-Lab

## Projects I'm Proud Of

- **Naive-Bayes-with-Front-End**: An implementation of the Naive Bayes theorem on a dataset, with a front end built using the Stream Lit library.
- **Tic-Tac-Toe**:  I brought the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe to life using Python and Pygame! 🎮💻 
- **Basic-Gym-Fitness-App**: A Java-based application is designed to help fitness enthusiasts of all levels track their workouts, monitor progress, and maintain a healthy lifestyle.

## Let's Connect!

I'm always up for a chat about tech, coding, or anything else under the sun. Feel free to reach out, and let's create something awesome together!
