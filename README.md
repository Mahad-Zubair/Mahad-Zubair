# Hi there! 👋 I'm Mahad Zubair

- 👀 I'm interested in exploring the endless possibilities of computer science and technology!
- 🌱 I'm currently diving deep into the realms of machine learning and web development.
- 💞️ I'm always on the lookout for exciting projects to collaborate on, so if you've got one, count me in!
- 📫 You can reach out to me via email at mahadzubair96@gmail.com or find me on [LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com/in/mahad-zubair-a07709223).

- ⚡ Fun fact: Did you know that the first computer bug was literally a bug? In 1947, Grace Hopper found a moth stuck in a relay of the Harvard Mark II computer, and that's where the term "debugging" came from!

## About Me

I'm a passionate computer science student currently sailing through my 7th semester. With a blend of curiosity and caffeine, I'm always ready to tackle new challenges and learn something new. When I'm not coding, you can find me sipping on coffee, exploring the latest tech trends, or playing video games.
